# ENCRYPTION-DECRYPTION-OF-PHRASES-AND-FILES
## Introduction
Vigenère Cipher was invented in 1553 by the Italian cryptographer Giovan Battista Bellaso but for
centuries it was attributed to the 16th-century French cryptographer Blaise de Vigenère. It is a type of
substitution cipher used for encrypting data in which the original plaintext structure is somewhat
concealed in the ciphertext by using several different monoalphabetic substitution ciphers rather than
just one; the code key specifies which particular substitution is to be employed for encrypting.
The reason behind choosing this cipher is its high complexity which increases from its security aspects
compared to other ciphers.
This program allows users to encrypt and decrypt their choice of a text phrase or file using either a
random key or a specific one chosen by the user, depending on their preferences.
## Instructions for Running the Program
Beginning with an output message conveyed on the screen asking the user’s decision of starting the
program, after typing “start” the program will initiate, asking some questions, like if the user wants to
encrypt or decrypt and whether it’s a phrase or a file and do the user wish to use a random key or to
input one himself.
The user will be asked to enter several format types depending on the operation for instance in the
beginning the user will be asked to enter “Start” to run the program. Another example, is entering the
text to encrypted which may include numbers, characters, and special characters.
The expected output differs depending on the operation chosen but, in all cases, a simple explanation of
the output will be conveyed beforehand any output, like; “cipher text: ' z0%[_<^$(+K6% ' “.
## Sequence of code:
The code runs according to the user’s preference starting with a greeting followed by a question of
either start the program or not. After that, an if statement which asks about the type of operation
whether it’s encryption or decryption. Moving along there is another if statement which wonders about
type of text will it be plain text or will it be stored in a file. And then the user will decide upon the key
type, after that the program runs smoothly executing all chosen commands and before starting again it
requests the user to input “start” for it to continue running.
